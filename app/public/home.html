                <p>Find Friends has been finding friends for five years now. In that time we have processed 
                    hundreds of surveys and successfully matched dozens of friends. 
                </p>
                <p>You can be confident of the results of the survey because we have invested at least three days in 
                    putting this process together just for you. We have used all the latest personality analysis techniques.
                    We have discussed the system with a number of psychologists and psychiartrists as well during our
                    own appointments to be treated for loneliness and paranoia.  
                </p>
                <p>So if you've exhaused every possibility of finding someone who wants to spend time with you
                    then it's time for you to resort to computerized surveys like this one. We promise that you
                    will get all the results you paid for!
